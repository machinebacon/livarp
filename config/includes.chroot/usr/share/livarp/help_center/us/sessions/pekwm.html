            <p><b>PeKwm</b> is a window manager for X developped by Claes Nästèn. extremly configurable, based on aewm++, pekwm proposes tab navigation, keybinds &amp; keychains, editable menu, autoproperties for clients... all in differents configuration files .. many files :D</p>

            <h2>startup</h2>
            <p>pekwm is launched by the ~/bin/start/pekwm_start.sh script.<br />
            to change your startup applications, simply edit this file: <text class="blockquote">vim bin/start/pekwm_start.sh</text> or from the pekwm menu:section pekwm:config:edit pekwm startup</p>
            <h2>components</h2>
            <p><b>pekwm</b> has many features, but i've added <b>conky</b> <b>fbpanel</b> and <b>lxpanel</b> as tasklist (icons-only), on top-right corner of your screen (configurable from lxpanel itself with a right-click:add/delete applets).</p>
            <h2>configuration</h2>
            <p>to configure <b>conky</b>, simply edit its conkyrc: <text class="blockquote">vim .conky/conkyrc_pekwm</text> or from the pekwm menu:section config:conky.</p>
            <p><b>lxpanel</b>, has its own configuration editor in graphic mode. right-click on panel to enable lxpanel configuration. for more info, visit lxpanel <a href="../config/panel.html">dedicated page</a>.</p>
            <p><b>fbpanel</b> includes menu &amp; systray, please visit the <a href="../config/menu.html">dedicated page</a>.</p>
            <h3>pekwmconfiguration</h3>
            <p>you can configure pekwm by editing its configuration files available in ~/.pekwm/*</p>
            <ul><li><b>~/.pekwm/start:</b> here you can add applications to be launched on pekwm startup. note that it also gets re-run every time pekwm is restarted. so, you may add startup apps in your ~/bin/start/pekwm_start.sh if you don't want to run processes two times.<br />
            you can use it to display a random wallpaper:</li></ul>
            <p class="blockquote">#!/bin/sh<br />
# PekWM start file<br />
# This file is a simple shell script; It gets run on pekwm startup, after <br />
# the theme and all config has loaded if it is set executable<br />
# (chmod +x start).<br />
#<br />
# This is different from ~/.xinitrc because a normal configuration of <br />
# .xinitrc you'll run all commands, then launch the window manager last.<br />
#<br />
# It also gets re-run every time pekwm is restarted.<br />
# <br />
# As for it's usefulness, well, it's up to you. I actually set my background<br />
# from my start file; since it runs after the theme gets loaded, this <br />
# effectively overrides whatever's in the theme.<br />
# <br />
# There's probably a few other good uses for it, too. I mainly pushed for it<br />
# because when I was doing fluxbox's docs, people used to complain that there<br />
# wasn't one, and I wanted to avoid that for pekwm. ;) --eyez<br />
 <br />
# random wallpaper script #<br />
# depends on feh '# apt-get install feh' #<br />
