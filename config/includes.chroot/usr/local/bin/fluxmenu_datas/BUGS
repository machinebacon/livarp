The old BUGS -file got corrupted so I don't remember what bugs there was...
Please inform me of them.

* Drag and drop allows dropping on other items than submenus that will make
  the item work like a submenu. That will possibly break the menu when saving
  (though it may look good in editor)

* Loading a corrupted menu could lead to crash. This is not tested

* Undo seems to work, I have not yet fully tested it though.

* Adding a big icon, like 1000x1000 breaks the UI. I could use some scaling.
